      <description>Last time, I wrote about a quiz from work, including the code solution. Unfortunately, I didn’t really like how the code block was printed in the minimal theme. I’m pretty sure there’s a quick and/or easy fix, but since I’m starting this blogging thing, I decided to try some other themes while at it.
It took some googling/reading/tweaking, but I ended up with Yihui’s XMin theme, and overall I’m satisfied with what I ended up with at the moment.</description>
