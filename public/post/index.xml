      <description>Here it is, the very first trivia! Frankly I was initially curious which schools have kept winning against UNC and found out which, but to start off things on a positive note :) I’m posting which schools have never won against UNC since 1949-50 season while having played UNC at least 10 times.
Two of the four teams featured above are on schedule for 2017-2018 season, so it’ll be interesting to see if UNC can keep the winning streak.</description>
