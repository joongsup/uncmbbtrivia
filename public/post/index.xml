      <description>Ever since UNCMBB team’s season ended about a month ago, I’ve been meaning to update the data in uncmbb package, and I finally got to it. Obviously the new version includes 2017-2018 season match results for both UNC and Duke MBB teams, but it also includes new features in wrapper functions that are useful when working with uncmbb package.
I forgot to take notes of the steps taken when I was submitting uncmbb to CRAN for the first time last year, and this time I remembered to do so and take some screenshots too.</description>

      <description>In reviewing details of random forest, I came upon several concepts that I thought were both interesting and important enough to be highlighted in a separate post. Mainly for my own reference, but if it helps others, that’d be great too!
Various categorical variable encoding methods and related concepts  Reference cell coding (dummy encoding/one-hot encoding)  How categorical variables are treated (by default?) in regressions in R Appreciating R’s way of doing things (behind the scence) Turns out same thing as dummy coding!</description>

      <description>I’m revisiting some nitty gritty details of a popular classification/regression method, random forest that I’ve put aside for whatever reasons.
Example setting  Objective: binary classification N = 5M observations p = 10 variables (5 categorical and 5 continuous variables) ntree = 100 mtry = determined by resampling (10-fold cv)   Bootstrap samples for each tree  Bootstrap samples of same size as the original data (N) is taken for each tree.</description>

      <description>Maëlle Salmon reminded me to submit posts/blog RSS feed to R weekly on my tweet, and I set out to do just that. I didn’t have much understanding as to how to though, and googling things like “how to generate rss feed in xmin blogdown” didn’t really turn up anything useful for new bloggers like me. Maybe it’s a quite straighforward knowledge that my full blog url is not a valid RSS feed address, but I got to know that only after checking my blog url from the R weekly submit page.</description>

      <title>Run system commands or shell scripts from an interactive R session</title>

      <description>When you are working in an interactive R shell and need to run some system commands, you can use a base R function system1.
# toy example system(&amp;quot;ls&amp;quot;) The system funtion can also be used to run custom shell scripts, like so,
system(&amp;quot;custom_script.sh arg1 arg2&amp;quot;) where custom_script.sh is a shell script that does some custom operations with arg1 and arg2. For example, let’s say I want to extract all the lines in a source file that contains the word “NOTE”.</description>

      <title>New Hugo theme</title>
      <link>/post/2018/02/03/new-hugo-theme/</link>

      <description>Last time, I wrote about a quiz from work, including the code solution. Unfortunately, I didn’t really like how the code block was printed in the minimal theme. I’m pretty sure there’s a quick and/or easy fix, but since I’m starting this blogging thing, I decided to try some other themes while at it.
It took some googling/reading/tweaking, but I ended up with Yihui’s XMin theme, and overall I’m satisfied with what I ended up with at the moment.</description>

      <description>There are 25 black balls and 25 white balls in a jar. We take two balls at random from the jar, and the one of the three: (1) if two black balls are drawn, put them back in to the jar; (2) if two white balls are drawn, throw them away; (3) if mixed, put a white ball back in, and throw away the black ball. We win this game when a white ball is the only ball remaining in the jar.</description>

      <title>3 game losing streak</title>

      <description>Here we go again. 3 Ls in a row. When was the last time we had this kind of losing skid?
So the last time there was a 3-game losing streak was back in 2014, and to my surprise,
I got curious as to what the worst losing streak was since 1950 season. To do that I’m looking at the number of seasons with losing streaks up to certain nuber.</description>

      <title>Blog at rbind.io</title>
      <link>/post/2018/01/29/blog-at-rbind-io/</link>

      <description>This weekend, I made a small but meaningful change to the blog that I started late last year. Initially, my blog was named UNCMBBTRIVIA to emphasize to the readers that this blog is about my beloved UNC Men’s Basketball team’s trivia. But I always wanted to have a blog where I write not only about UNC MBB trivia, but more importantly about data analysis and R.
As I thought about it more, it became clear that I’d better drop the UNCMBBTrivia-only identity of the blog to start writing more about data analysis and R, and ever since then I’ve been thinking about how and when to make the change.</description>

      <title>One year after rstudio::conf 2017</title>

      <description>It was merely a name change, but with the new blog address at rbind.io, I’m excited about the fact that I am a blogger who uses his name in his blog address, because I’ve always considered it to be one of the coolest things you can do online :) And it got me thinking, where did it all start from? After many failed attempts to start and maintain my own blog, how is it that this time, it seems it’ll just work?</description>
