      <description>In my first uncmbbtrivia post last week, I looked at perfect winning series of UNC MBB team, particularly looking for those schools that the team has never lost to since 1949-50 season (minimum of 10 games). Again, say hello to: Citadel, Rutgers, Stanford, and Tulane :)
This week, I look at the opposite end of the series history. Are there any schools that the UNC MBB team kept losing to? I know we haven’t been playing particularly well against Duke lately, so at least I knew depending on how far back I go that there will be some schools that we have losing series against.</description>

Before writing about the other end of the spectrum in series history, I started reading the 2009 champion season book, “One Fantastic Ride: The Inside Story of Carolina Basketball’s 2009 Championship Season” and posted about it on twitter: “Re-reading my fav 4 seasons of all time in @UNC_Basketball (so far) while waiting on the latest by the great @jadamlucas #uncmbbtrivia”.</description>

      <description>Here it is, the very first trivia! Frankly I was initially curious which schools have winning series against UNC and found out which (and here’s the link to that post), but to start off things on a positive note :) I’m posting which schools have never won against UNC since 1949-50 season while having played UNC at least 10 times.
There they are: Citadel, Rutgers, Stanford, and Tulane! Two of these teams are on UNC’s schedule for upcoming 2017-2018 season, so it’ll be interesting to see if UNC can keep the winning streak.</description>
