      <description>When you are working in an interactive R shell and need to run some system commands, you can use a base R function system1.
# toy example system(&amp;quot;ls&amp;quot;) The system funtion can also be used to run custom shell scripts, like so,
system(&amp;quot;custom_script.sh arg1 arg2&amp;quot;) where custom_script.sh is a shell script that does some custom operations with arg1 and arg2. For example, let’s say I want to extract all the lines in a source file that contains the word “NOTE”.</description>

      <title>New Hugo theme</title>

      <description>Last time, I wrote about a quiz from work, including the code solution. Unfortunately, I didn’t really like how the code block was printed in the minimal theme. I’m pretty sure there’s a quick and/or easy fix, but since I’m starting this blogging thing, I decided to try some other themes while at it.
It took some googling/reading/tweaking, but I ended up with Yihui’s XMin theme, and overall I’m satisfied with what I ended up with at the moment.</description>

      <description>There are 25 black balls and 25 white balls in a jar. We take two balls at random from the jar, and the one of the three: (1) if two black balls are drawn, put them back in to the jar; (2) if two white balls are drawn, throw them away; (3) if mixed, put a white ball back in, and throw away the black ball. We win this game when a white ball is the only ball remaining in the jar.</description>

      <title>3 game losing streak</title>

      <description>Here we go again. 3 Ls in a row. When was the last time we had this kind of losing skid?
So the last time there was a 3-game losing streak was back in 2014, and to my surprise,
I got curious as to what the worst losing streak was since 1950 season. To do that I’m looking at the number of seasons with losing streaks up to certain nuber.</description>

      <title>Blog at rbind.io</title>
      <link>/post/2018/01/29/blog-at-rbind-io/</link>

      <description>This weekend, I made a small but meaningful change to the blog that I started late last year. Initially, my blog was named UNCMBBTRIVIA to emphasize to the readers that this blog is about my beloved UNC Men’s Basketball team’s trivia. But I always wanted to have a blog where I write not only about UNC MBB trivia, but more importantly about data analysis and R.
As I thought about it more, it became clear that I’d better drop the UNCMBBTrivia-only identity of the blog to start writing more about data analysis and R, and ever since then I’ve been thinking about how and when to make the change.</description>

      <description>It was merely a name change, but with the new blog address at rbind.io, I’m excited about the fact that I am a blogger who uses his name in his blog address, because I’ve always considered it to be one of the coolest things you can do online :) And it got me thinking, where did it all start from? After many failed attempts to start and maintain my own blog, how is it that this time, it seems it’ll just work?</description>

      <title>Data Analysis Workflow at Work</title>
      <link>/post/2018/01/19/data-analysis-workflow/</link>

      <description>Introduction Data analysis workflow. This is one of my favorite topics in data science, because it deals with everything from data ingestion to report/insight documentation in a project. One might say applying tidyverse approach/techniques is a micro level data science skill, whereas following a specific workflow, which can vary from one person to another, is a macro level one. Tidyverse can definitely be a part of your workflow, and there are many other components of a workflow that I touch on later, but why should we care about data analysis workflow?</description>

      <description>Combining command line tools and R commands
R package itself   command line utilities R wrapper functions  How functions in R package are used   Use the wrapper functions in interactive way (explore.R) Use the wrapper functions in another .R script  Call the .R script in command line tools Make the .R script into R command line utility itself   What I have so far:</description>

      <title>Same day match results: UNC and Duke</title>
      <link>/post/2018/01/07/same-day-match-results-unc-and-duke/</link>

      <description>So both UNC and Duke lost today (Saturday, 2018-01-06). I’d think it’s pretty rare that such event (both teams losing on a same day) happens, and I got curious how rare it is indeed. What are the odds of both teams winning, losing (like today), and splitting?
I knew both teams have approximately 75% win percentage (since 1949-50 season), so I’m guessing on any given day, the probability of both teams winning should be close to 0.</description>

      <title>Days between games</title>

      <description>After a long (exam) break, next up for the Tar Heels is Tennessee on Sunday, 12/17. 11 days since the last game against Western Carolina seemed unusually long to just another casual fan here, and I was curious how usual or unusual 11 days between any two games are.
I started with the frequency of days between two consecutive regular season games since 1949-50 season.
Ok, it looks like the majority of regular season games were 3 days apart, with such games accounting for approximately 28% (or 504 games) of all the regular season games played since 1949-50 season.</description>
