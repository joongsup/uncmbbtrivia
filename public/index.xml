      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;It’s just that kind of season for UNCMBB. When the UVA’s 3 pointer was fired at the end of the game, I’m sure I wasn’t the only one among the Carolina fans who knew it’d go in, because it’s just that kind of season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been coping with the season by instead working harder (?), but after today’s home loss to VA, I decided to write this post (and actually publish it), because, something’s got to be done. We go where we go and do what we do, but at this point, I’m just hoping the first blog post for the season helps the team break the streak of bad karma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have just the perfect topic too, as for the past couple of weeks, I’ve been playing with GNU Screen and found several good (I think) ingredients for day-to-day workflow. Like so, I just hope my Tar Heels also find some working solutions for the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started using Screen mainly for its attach/detach capability. Run a long runing job in a Screen session, detach, go home, reattach and check the long running job’s status. Good news is that the long running job is not lost. More recently, I also started using Screen as script/console pair. So, for example, I’d start a Screen session, called “R” (by screen -S R), and interactively work with scripts via Vim-slime plugin. I wrote about such workflow &lt;a href=&#34;https://joongsup.rbind.io/post/2018/10/06/vim-and-slime/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. What’s important in this way of using Screen is that one Screen session is specific to one and only one utility. If I needed an R REPL, I’d start a Screen session for it. If I needed a Python REPL, I’d start another Screen session for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then not long ago, I learned a single Screen session can have multiple windows (or “tabs”) in it. What that means is that instead of starting multiple Screen sessions (usually through multiple ssh logins), I’d start a single Screen session, then have multiple windows, each window responsible for specific utility, such as R, Python, and/or git. So for example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;screen -S projectA
screen -t R
screen -t Python
screen -t git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would start a Screen session called “projectA”, and from within it, 3 additional windows called R, Python, and git are created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:example&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/screen_session_windows.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Screen session and windows&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 1: Screen session and windows
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that once the Screen session called “projectA” is created, default window called “bash” is started within the session, followed by subsequent windows called R, Python, and git, respectively via screen -t calls. The session name, as well as the window names are displayed at the bottom, and that can be configured in .screenrc file like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
# generates equivalent of $STY followed by &amp;quot;on $HOST&amp;quot; if $STY is non-standard
backtick 10 60 60 sh -c &amp;#39;sty=$(screen -ls | grep --color=no -o &amp;quot;$PPID[^[:space:]]*&amp;quot;) ; if [ ${sty##*.} = $HOST ] ; then echo $sty ; else echo &amp;quot;$sty&amp;quot; ; fi&amp;#39;

# display session and windows name
hardstatus alwayslastline
hardstatus string &amp;#39;%{= kG}%u %10`%{-b kw}%u %-Lw%{= rW}%50&amp;gt; %n%f %t %{-}%+Lw%&amp;lt;&amp;#39;

# shift/arrow (move to prev/next window)
bindkey &amp;quot;^[[1;2C&amp;quot; next
bindkey &amp;quot;^[[1;2D&amp;quot; prev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t ask me how I ended up with such commands, which required mix-and-match of several google searches. The key binding is also a result of googling, and it allows me to move to prev/next windows within a Screen session with shift-arrow keys. I use iTerm2 for terminal app, and cmd/shift-arrow and cmd-arrow are already configured for other types of moves, and so far, shift-arrow binding works quite nicely to move between prev/next windows within a Screen session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I arrived here, it was only natural to go ahead and write some bash scripts that would start a screen session with frequently used utilities of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash

if [ -z &amp;quot;$1&amp;quot; ]; then
    echo &amp;quot;Provide screen&amp;#39;s session title and optional services. Typically session title = project&amp;#39;s (main) name and services one of R/python/julia&amp;quot;
    echo &amp;quot;Usage: devsetup.sh projectA &amp;#39;R julia&amp;#39;&amp;quot;
else
    session=$1

    # default windows
    screen -dmS $session
    screen -S $session -X screen -t home

    if [ ! -z &amp;quot;$2&amp;quot; ]; then
        servs=$2
        # optional services to start
        for serv in ${servs[@]}
            do
                if [ $(echo &amp;quot;${serv}&amp;quot; | tr &amp;#39;[:upper:]&amp;#39; &amp;#39;[:lower:]&amp;#39;) = &amp;quot;r&amp;quot; ]; then
                    screen -S $session -X screen -t R -X /usr/local/bin/R --vanilla
                elif [ $(echo &amp;quot;${serv}&amp;quot; | tr &amp;#39;[:upper:]&amp;#39; &amp;#39;[:lower:]&amp;#39;) = &amp;quot;julia&amp;quot; ]; then
                    screen -S $session -X screen -t julia -X /usr/local/bin/julia
               fi
            done
    fi
    screen -r $session -p home
fi
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This script allows me to start a Screen session for each project with frequently used utilities, and with the project’s home document (as defined &lt;a href=&#34;https://joongsup.rbind.io/post/2019/10/17/rmarkdown-centered-data-analysis-workflow/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) open in the “home” window, I can go about working on the project using other Screen functionalities, i.e., attach/detach, and script/console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For RStudio users, if you squint a bit, this Screen session/windows workflow seems to match well the idea behind the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects&#34;&gt;RStudio Project&lt;/a&gt;. For each project, I’d start its own Screen session with corresponding utilities needed for the project, and each project enjoys its own R session without interfering with other R sessions opened in other projects. Note in the last screenshot, I’m using two tabs in iTerm2, one tab for each project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:projA&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/screen_projA.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Screen session for Project A&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 2: Screen session for Project A
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:projB&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/screen_projB.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Screen session for Project B&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 3: Screen session for Project B
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:projAll&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/screen_projAll.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Screen like RStudio Project&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this post helps anyone interested in data science workflow (esp using Vim), but most importantly, hope I can claim somehow in next couple of days that I have contributed to breaking the team’s bad karma. Go Heels!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>R Markdown template in Vim</title>
      <link>/post/2019/12/16/r-markdown-template-in-vim/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2019/12/16/r-markdown-template-in-vim/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;In my last post, I wrote about an R Markdown centered data analysis workflow that I found to be helpful for many of my work. Helpful, in terms of improving code reusability and remembering what has been done for a particular project. Idea is that I’d start any (ad-hoc) data analysis project with a home Rmd document to store both codes and narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It followed naturally that I soon started hoping to start a new Rmd document with some predefined default setting in Vim, e.g., metadata such as title, date, and output options, etc., as well as R packages that I’d use all the time. I knew RStudio IDE provides template functionality, but I wanted to be able to do it in the tool/environment that I spend most time in daily. So I started looking around, and quickly ran into several blog posts on how to use Vim templates&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes down to the following two components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a skeleton file for a specific target file extension, e.g., an Rmd skeleton file (for .Rmd files), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vim commands to insert the contents of the skeleton file to the newly created file with the target extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, an Rmd skeleton file (e.g., skeleton.Rmd) can contain yaml headers and an R setup chunk like below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
title: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
date: &amp;quot;yyyy-mm-dd (updated &amp;#39;r Sys.Date()&amp;#39;)&amp;quot;
output:
    html_document:
        toc: true
        number_sections: true
        theme: flatly
        highlight: kate
---&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;```{r setup_r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
library(reticulate)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8)

use_python(PYTHON_PATH) # PYTHON_PATH defined in .Rprofile

# Introduction
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not the main topic, I had to look up how to display my yaml headers and R code chunk verbatim in a post like above, and found out some tricks from the code &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown-book/blob/master/02-basics.Rmd&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; for the R Markdown: The Definitive Guide book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once skeleton.Rmd is ready (e.g., ~/.vim/templates/skeleton.Rmd), Vim can insert the contents of the skeleton file to the newly created .Rmd file with autocmd like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;if has(&amp;quot;autocmd&amp;quot;)
  augroup templates
    autocmd BufNewFile *.Rmd 0r ~/.vim/templates/skeleton.Rmd
  augroup END
endif
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above Vim codes resides in .vimrc file and reads in the skeleton.Rmd file whenever a new .Rmd file is created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I followed this blog &lt;a href=&#34;https://shapeshed.com/vim-templates/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on how to use Vim templates&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#relevantfuture-work&#34;&gt;Relevant/future work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;tldr&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TLDR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A summary is &lt;a href=&#34;http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/joongsup/workflow/blob/master/workflow.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the codes are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/joongsup/workflow/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a workflow fanatic. Ok, fanatic maybe too strong a word, but that’s what I told one of my R stars when I met her in person recently, who’s also passionate about (in my views) project workflow and “generally doing basic stuff really, really well”. I can’t pinpoint how and why I became so interested in establishing a good project workflow, but it’s one of those things that I really wish I had mastered while I was still in school. Maybe the lack of such training during graduate school led me down this path of caring about research computing education as well as getting involved with Software/Data Carpentry, which I wish I had known about it back then&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My pursuit of a data analysis workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(also something about notebooks)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, coming up with a workflow that suits me for most of my needs either at home or at work has been a long journey of mine, and I’ve written a couple of posts on here for some “milestones”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://joongsup.rbind.io/post/2019/04/05/r-markdown-revisited/&#34;&gt;R Markdown in Vim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t written about it yet, but I also started using Python pretty heavily at work, and my interest in workflow since then has been about how to put together codes (R/Python/SQL) and by-products (findings/plots) more efficiently in R Markdown. The idea of combining codes and prose is not new at all, with ever growing popularity of using notebooks by data scientists for doing just that. I have used notebooks too (e.g., RCloud, Jupyter Notebook, etc.) in the past, but for various reasons it never stuck with me. It’s still hard to pinpoint exatly what, but if I have to guess, among many pros and cons of notebooks, what didn’t work for me was the lack of the final/intermediate by-product (e.g., a summary document with findings, tables, and plots) that I can refer back to anytime in the future. Most likely due to how I used it (inefficiently, that is), my notebooks were always in-progress, never-ending, ever-changing, without the merit of reusable codes. Yihui’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://yihui.name/en/2018/09/notebook-war/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on notebooks, IDEs, and R Markdown comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-im-hoping-for-in-a-data-analysis-workflow&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I’m hoping for in a data analysis workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R Markdown seemed a promising component of a workflow, especially in terms of being a central place where I can document what I tried, which scripts I used, and finally the findings from each code exeucution that can help me understand a project’s “whereabout” anytime I needed to. And here I’m hoping my workflow to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include Vim, my text editor of choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be language-agnostic (within R and Python)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allow quick interactive code checking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;produce a summary document that includes codes/tables/plots/findings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;promote code reusability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several trial-and-error, I feel like what I have at the moment is a good working version of an R Markdown centered workflow, specifically for data analysis using text editor of choice, Vim. I understand there are several components here that can make this workflow rather specific than general (e.g., Vim, not RStudio), but I believe the general idea can still be helpful for others as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;so-whats-it-look-like&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, what’s it look like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I was going to write about the workflow with an example in this blog post, but since it included a working example, it became a bit confusing structure-wise to include the working example (I’m sure there’s a way to do it), so I decided to use github &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/joongsup/workflow&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; instead for code examples as well as the final summary document. So think of this blog post as an introduction/motivation for the actual work that is stored in github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href=&#34;http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/joongsup/workflow/blob/master/workflow.html&#34;&gt;subtitle&lt;/a&gt; of the main document in the repo says, I also talk about how to use Python codes in R Markdown using &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/&#34;&gt;reticulate&lt;/a&gt; package. In fact, three types of coding examples are given:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to use R codes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to use Python codes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to use R objects in Python, and Python objects in R&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each type of examples, three different scenarios are used in terms of how to incorporate corresponding codes into the R Markdown document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work with code snippets directly in R Markdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;import/source function definitions from separate script files and use them in R Markdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;display outputs from separate script files in R Markdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although not perfect and still under development, I feel like I now have a portable and transferable workflow for data analysis that I can mix and match depending on the scope of any projects. As someone said, just trying to do “basic stuff really, really well”, so that it just “flows”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;relevantfuture-work&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Relevant/future work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the time I started reconsidering R Markdown as part of my workflow, I ran into Emily Riederer’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://emilyriederer.netlify.com/post/rmarkdown-driven-development/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on RMarkdown driven development (nicely worded!), and it’s a great read. I haven’t tried to link my workflow in terms of packaging, which I also care about a lot, but such conversion seems an interesting/challenging idea. E.g., as it stands, my home R Markdown document lives in the root project directory, which is not allowed in R package structure. I’m sure I can just move the R Markdown to /doc directory, but there could be something I’m missing here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just last night, I ran into Miles McBain’s tweet that was something about Rmd and reproducibility (so timely!):
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;This morning&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; surprise: Rmd files are not rendered reproducibly when render() is called from console. Opposite behaviour to the &amp;#39;knit&amp;#39; button in &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rstudio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@rstudio&lt;/a&gt;. Beware!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Miles McBain (@MilesMcBain) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MilesMcBain/status/1184993769814315008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;October 18, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactive use (of R and Python shells) in a data analysis project workflow and “search path” are two topics that I think about quite a lot these days, but in terms of loss of reproducibility when Rmd files are rendered in console, I must have been impacted by it, as in the workflow I described in this post, I render my home R Markdown document in console. Either I might have overlooked its impact or I haven’t run into any such loss of reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems they were getting seriuos just as I was wrapping up my time in school&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Two ways to render R Markdown documents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw this tweet a couple of days ago and decided to look for ways to use R Markdown more at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;TIL you can embed a &amp;quot;code download&amp;quot; button in an HTML &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rmarkdown?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rmarkdown&lt;/a&gt; doc so that users can click to download your source .Rmd from the rendered HTML version...without GitHub 🤩 &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YAML:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---&lt;br&gt;output:&lt;br&gt;  html_document:&lt;br&gt;    code_download: true&lt;br&gt;---&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Test: &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/bp7w7XKF8b&#34;&gt;https://t.co/bp7w7XKF8b&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/uMQK0mvYcF&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uMQK0mvYcF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alison Hill (@apreshill) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/1108925218850893832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;March 22, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not like I haven’t tried to use R Markdown before&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but at the time of this &lt;a href=&#34;https://joongsup.rbind.io/post/2018/07/22/comments-on-data-analysis-workflow/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, I hadn’t been able to find a way to effectively incorporate R Markdown at work for various reasons. Since then, however, I added a couple of new tools to my data analysis toolbox&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which I felt might help make it work this time using R Markdown more at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;render-r-markdown-from-vim-without-opening-r&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Render R Markdown from Vim (without opening R)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there was a Vim plug-in for R Markdown indeed! In fact, a quick online search led me to three relevant/required Vim plug-ins: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-rmarkdown&#34;&gt;vim-rmarkdown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc&#34;&gt;vim-pandoc&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax&#34;&gt;vim-pandoc-syntax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the plug-in instructions, as well as this helpful configuration &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34314214/vim-rmarkdown-plugin-configuration&#34;&gt;tip&lt;/a&gt;, I was up and running with vim-rmarkdown plug-in in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:all&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/vim_rmd_work.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Rendering R Markdown Document from within Vim&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 1: Rendering R Markdown Document from within Vim
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the syntax highlighting (from vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax plug-ins), the vim-rmarkdown plug-in provides a function to render a source R Markdown document into output types of interest (e.g., html) from within the source R Markdown document in Vim. &lt;strong&gt;:RMarkdown&lt;/strong&gt; command does the job, and it displays successful run message once the rendering is complete&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;render-r-markdown-and-send-email-from-r&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Render R Markdown (and send email) from R&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R Markdown documents can also be rendered from R too, by the usual &lt;strong&gt;rmarkdown::render()&lt;/strong&gt; function. Generally one can review the rendered output by clicking the output file, but what if such clicking/reviewing is not an option? That’s a challenge I’m facing at work. Ok, maybe there’s a way to click/review a remote file, and if that’s the case, then nobody hasn’t told me how to just yet :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there’s a better way, but the workaround I came up with has two steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Render R Markdown document (rmarkdown::render())&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send an email to self with rendered output as attachment (sendmailR::sendmail()).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know about the sendmailR package before, but the package lets you send emails from within R. I ended up writing a couple of wrapper functions (saved in my personal package) so that rendering and sending email can be done all at once by a single function call. Yes there are some drawbacks&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve been happy with the workflow so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, I use R Markdown for all the posts in this blog :)&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;E.g., incorporating &lt;a href=&#34;https://joongsup.rbind.io/post/2018/10/06/Vim-and-slime/&#34;&gt;Vim-slime&lt;/a&gt; and GNU &lt;a href=&#34;https://joongsup.rbind.io/post/2018/08/26/gnu-make-for-workflow-manager/&#34;&gt;Make&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m missing something, but it would be even better if it shows the rendering stage, e.g., completion %&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn4&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One main drawback I found, ironically, is that I have yet to find a way to download the source R Markdown document using the code_download option as in the above tweet. Maybe the source R Markdown document also needs to be sent via email along with the output?&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Coping with worst loss at home</title>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;It’s been a tough weekend, not least because Tar Heels lost at home. Sometimes I feel like I’m vested too much in the outcome of the Heel’s basketball games, and if my emotional rollercoaster the rest of the weekend gives any clue, I probably am, just a litttle bit. I tried to shake it off, yet it wasn’t particularly easy, not only because we lost at home, but because the loss was the worst one at home under Roy Williams. So I turn to blogging, after 100+ days of hiatus, as a last resort to restoring my inner peace and calm, before the new workday begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I look at a couple of worst of the worst losses at home (to make the last loss less painful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;table&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, 4 losses to Duke (gee, a loss by 35!) and a couple to State (a loss by 21, which matches the weekend’s loss margin). At this point, I’m realizing this is not particularly going to help me feel better about the weekend’s loss. Worse, it might exacerbate the wound, but I decide to keep going. What’s all the home losses look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-01-13-worst-performance-at-home-sweet-dome_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1152&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-01-13-worst-performance-at-home-sweet-dome_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png&#34; width=&#34;1152&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, of the 122 total home losses (since 1949-50 season), loss by 4 is the most frequent (14 games), followed by loss by 1 (13 games). Sure, Duke won the most with 25 wins against UNC, followed by State (16), Wake Forest (15), and Maryland (13). Other than these 4 schools, no schools have won at UNC more than 6 times since 1949-50 season. I’m already starting to feel a little better. While at it, I decide to look at how Duke’s home loss look like for the heck of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, of the 135 Duke’s home losses (since 1949-50 season), Carolina beat them 29 times, followed by State (21), Wake Forest (15), Maryland (14), and Virginia (9). Other than these 5 schools, no schools have beat Duke more than 6 times since 1949-50 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, a good start. There’s been only 30 home losses since 2003-04 season, approximately 2 home losses per season. Only 2 down days over a 4 months period each season. Put it that way, I feel like I can survive this weekend’s L.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-01-13-worst-performance-at-home-sweet-dome_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1152&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-01-13-worst-performance-at-home-sweet-dome_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png&#34; width=&#34;1152&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2003-04 season, again loss by 1 and 4 were most frequent, each with 4 games. Not surprisingly, Duke has won 8 games at UNC, and somewhat surprisingly, Miami has second most wins at UNC since RW came home. This weekend’s win gives Louisville its first win at Carolina, it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the worst home loss in 16 years, what made things worse for me personally was the fact that Duke won their game against Florida State later same day. Again, this is just me, but after the home loss, I was begging for Florida State to win their home game, so that I can have somewhat so-so weekend even with the home loss, even though I knew how &lt;a href=&#34;https://joongsup.rbind.io/post/2018/01/07/same-day-match-results-unc-and-duke/&#34;&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; such event was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, 22 such days when Carolina lost at home while Duke won on the same day since 1949-50 season. And only 6 such days since 2003-04 season. Make it 7 with this weekend’s case, but nevertheless at the end of the day, an L is an L, and we had two road Ws before this L, and I hope the team shook it off well over the weekend. Writing this post definitely helped me feel a whole lot better about this weekend and get ready for a new day tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, I saw a thread in my tweeter feed that was talking about what should be the first thing that a data scientist student learns. There were two answers that made sense to me: SQL and visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL, because, one needs to be able to get desired data from somewhere, and for the most part in an industry setting at least, that somewhere is typically some form of databases (e.g., relational database, hive, etc.), which can be accessed by SQL-like languages. As far as basics go, I think being able to select data (with conditions) and create/drop table should carry one surprisingly a long way in a data science journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visualizaton, because, one needs to be able to show acquired data and analyses done on them in some kind of non-text form, and that non-text form typically involves graphs. As far as basics go, I think being able to show data on a bar chart and a line chart should carry one surprisingly a long way in a data science journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the same time, I started using Python a bit more at work, and with the twitter thread fresh in mind, I thought this might be a good time to write a post that compares how to do frequently used plotting in both R and Python. By frequently used plotting, I mean bar charts and line charts based on personal experience. I’ve been using bar chart usually for frequency of categorical variables and line chart for sequence of numerical variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’ll try to provide as minimal codes as possible to draw two flavors in each: simple chart and grouped chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Bar plot for frequency of categorical variable
- line plot for sequence of numerical variable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The schedule for the 2018-2019 UNC MBB season has been out, and I ran into a blog post that said something about some teams getting preferable schedules than others, in that those lucky teams get to play three consecutive games at home and in some case, not having to face the same number of consecutive games on the road. I remembered UNC team had a touch streak last season, having to play 3 in a row on the road, and with the current 15 member system (since 2010), such imbalance in schedule is bound to happen eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was curious in terms of playing consecutive home games and road games, who’s been lucky all these years. Let’s see.&lt;/p&gt;
