<p>Ever since UNCMBB team’s season ended about a month ago, I’ve been meaning to update the data in uncmbb package, and I finally got to it. Obviously the new version includes 2017-2018 season match results for both UNC and Duke MBB teams, but it also includes new features in wrapper functions that are useful when working with uncmbb package.</p>
<p>I forgot to take notes of the steps taken when I was submitting uncmbb to CRAN for the first time last year, and this time I remembered to do so and take some screenshots too. Below are some notes related to package submission:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update R and RStudio versions
<ul>
<li>This is one of the prompts asked when calling devtools::release(), which is almost<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> the final step in submitting a package to CRAN.</li>
<li>I didn’t really start with updating R and RStudio this time and only ended up doing so when I ran into this prompt.</li>
<li>For R version update, there seem to be much better ways to do it, but I ended up manually downloading latest R from CRAN and installing packages as I needed them, starting, e.g., with tidyverse. I could’ve copied over from previous version’s directory as well as personal directory, but I figured some packages needed to be updated anyway, so I might as well start anew with the packages.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make changes/load all/install and restart/document/check, and commit as needed.
<ul>
<li>This workflow (constant cycles of cmd-shift-L/B/D/E) makes sure my package is ok on current OS, which is Mac.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Travis CI builds linux (Ubuntu) binary package and makes sure package is ok on linux (Ubuntu).
<ul>
<li>I already added Travis-CI to uncmbb project during the season<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and added build badge to the package github page along with other badges<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once CI is passed, run devtools::build_win()
<ul>
<li>This function builds windows binary package and makes sure package is ok on windows (runs R CMD check on windows).</li>
<li>Built package and check log are sent to email.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once devtools::build_win() is passed, run devtools::release()
<ul>
<li>The function performs a series of tasks, and for the first several attempts, I kept getting this warning: “…* checking top-level files … WARNING Conversion of ‘README.md’ failed: pandoc: Could not fetch…TlsExceptionHostPort (HandshakeFailed Error_EOF)”img.shields.io&quot; 443…“.
<ul>
<li>It seemed pandoc had something to do with this warning, so after several searches, I ended up updating my pandoc via homebrew.</li>
<li>But even after I updated my pandoc, rmarkdown was still using the old version, and I found out I had to run brew link pandoc to use the latest version.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once devtools::release() is passed, do the following last step task:
<ul>
<li>Go to confirmation page provided in the submission confirmation email<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</li>
<li>Once confirmed on the page, there will be another cran submission confirmation email.</li>
<li>Less than an hour later, I received yet another email from CRAN team that says the updated package “is on its way to CRAN now”. Yay!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
