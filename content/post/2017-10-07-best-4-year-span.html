<p>In my first uncmbbtrivia post last week, I looked at some winning series of UNC MBB team, particularly those schools that the team has never lost to since 1949-50 season (minimum of 10 games). Say hello to: Citadel, Rutgers, Stanford, and Tulane :)</p>
<p>Before writing about the other end of the spectrum in series history, I started reading the 2009 champion season book, “One Fantastic Ride: The Inside Story of Carolina Basketball’s 2009 Championship Season” and posted about it on twitter: “Re-reading my fav 4 seasons of all time in <span class="citation">@UNC_Basketball</span> (so far) while waiting on the latest by the great <span class="citation">@jadamlucas</span> #uncmbbtrivia”.</p>
<p>It is indeed my favorite 4 years of UNC MBB history so far, because to me the 4-year span has everything the college basketball represents: new kids on campus –&gt; massive development –&gt; fall from the highest stage –&gt; redemption and championship.</p>
<p>I became curious how accomplished the core members of the championship team were and if there’s any other teams comparable to the 2005 freshmen group.</p>
