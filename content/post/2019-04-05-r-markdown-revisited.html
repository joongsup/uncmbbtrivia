<h2>Two ways to render R Markdown documents</h2>
<p>I saw this tweet a couple of days ago and decided to look for ways to use R Markdown more at work.</p>
{{% tweet "1108925218850893832" %}}
<p>It’s not like I haven’t tried to use R Markdown before<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, but at the time of this <a href="https://joongsup.rbind.io/post/2018/07/22/comments-on-data-analysis-workflow/">post</a>, I hadn’t been able to find a way to effectively incorporate R Markdown at work for various reasons. Since then, however, I added a couple of new tools to my data analysis toolbox<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, which I felt might help make it work this time using R Markdown more at work.</p>

<h3>Render R Markdown from Vim (without opening R)</h3>
<p>And there was a Vim plug-in for R Markdown indeed! In fact, a quick online search led me to three relevant/required Vim plug-ins: <a href="https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-rmarkdown">vim-rmarkdown</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc">vim-pandoc</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax">vim-pandoc-syntax</a>.</p>
<p>Following the plug-in instructions, as well as this helpful configuration <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34314214/vim-rmarkdown-plugin-configuration">tip</a>, I was up and running with vim-rmarkdown plug-in in no time.</p>

<p>In addition to the syntax highlighting (from vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax plug-ins), the vim-rmarkdown plug-in provides a function to render a source R Markdown document into output types of interest (e.g., html) from within the source R Markdown document in Vim. <strong>:RMarkdown</strong> command does the job, and it displays successful run message once the rendering is complete<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

<h3>Render R Markdown (and send email) from R</h3>
<p>R Markdown documents can also be rendered from R too, by the usual <strong>rmarkdown::render()</strong> function. Generally one can review the rendered output by clicking the output file, but what if such clicking/reviewing is not an option? That’s a challenge I’m facing at work. Ok, maybe there’s a way to click/review a remote file, and if that’s the case, then nobody hasn’t told me how to just yet :)</p>
<p>I’m sure there’s a better way, but the workaround I came up with has two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Render R Markdown document (rmarkdown::render())</li>
<li>Send an email to self with rendered output as attachment (sendmailR::sendmail()).</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t know about the sendmailR package before, but the package lets you send emails from within R. I ended up writing a couple of wrapper functions (saved in my personal package) so that rendering and sending email can be done all at once by a single function call. Yes there are some drawbacks<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, but I’ve been happy with the workflow so far.</p>
