<p>Unfortunately, I’m not going to the rstudio conference this year (training/conference schedule didn’t work out), and boy do I want to be there this week. For those of you lucky attendees, I hope you make the best out of the conference and enjoy everything you get to learn from amazing people and do amazing things after the conference.</p>
<p>I know you will :)</p>
