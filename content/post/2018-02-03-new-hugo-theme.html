<p>Last time, I wrote about a <a href="https://joongsup.rbind.io/post/2018/02/01/quiz-from-work/">quiz</a> from work, including the code solution. Unfortunately, I didn’t really like how the code block was printed in the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/minimal/">minimal</a> theme. I’m pretty sure there’s a quick and/or easy fix, but since I’m starting this blogging thing, I decided to try some other themes while at it.</p>
<p>It took some googling/reading/tweaking, but I ended up with Yihui’s <a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin">XMin</a> theme, and overall I’m satisfied with what I ended up with at the moment. It could’ve been helpful to record each and every step I took and write a blog post about it, but unfortunately, I didn’t record each and every step that I ended up taking. Nonetheless, I’ll try to summarize what I went through later for my own record, if anything.</p>
