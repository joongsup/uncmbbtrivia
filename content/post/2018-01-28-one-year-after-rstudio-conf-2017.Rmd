1. Hadley's autograph
2. Started using github
3. Wrote my first R (data) package (uncmbb), now available on CRAN
4. Started preaching tidyverse and RR at work
5. Started having a second thought about R package and tinkered with .Rprofile
6. Turned around once again and made a second R package, primarily for use at work (local)
7. Started a blog, now using rbind.io subdomain. 

Unfortunately, I'm not going to the rstudio conference this year (training/conference schedule didn't work out), and boy do I want to be there this week. For those of you lucky attendees, I hope you make the best out of the conference and enjoy everything you get to learn from amazing people and do amazing things after the conference. 

I know you will :)
