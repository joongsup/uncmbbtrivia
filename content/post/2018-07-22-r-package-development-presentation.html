<p>Like Yihui (of blogdown and many other awesome R packages) whose goal is to publish a book a year<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, I have a similar personal goal that I started last year. While I’d love to write a book a year, it’s too ambitious a goal for me (and many people in general, I’d think) to pursue. Instead, my personal goal is to do an external presentation a year, be it for meetups, conferences, or nearby schools as a guest speaker.</p>
<p>Back in May, I did a presentation on R package development for the ATL R User group, successfully completing the mission for the year :) The presentation has two decks: (1) main deck (<a href="https://joongsup.rbind.io/pdf/r_pkg_devel_final.pdf">here</a>) containing the introduction and high level overview, and (2) reference deck<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> (<a href="https://joongsup.rbind.io/slides/r_pkg_devel.html">here</a>) containing the screenshots of each step of the R package development that I covered during the presentation.</p>
<p>I should probably add to my personal goal list something about blog posting<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. I’m just happy still that blogging is this easy (again thanks to Yihui!), and so there should be no excuse why I can’t write a post more frequently. Well, I won’t make it an official personal goal just yet, but for now, I will have to keep writing posts whenever I can, sometimes multiple posts at one sitting, just like today! :)</p>
