## Create a new RStudio project. 
![project](/img/new_project.png)
![directory](/img/new_directory.png)
![pkg](/img/new_r_pkg.png)
Next the best part so far: we have to give the new package a name!
![name](/img/new_pkg_name.png)
![name ready](/img/new_pkg_name_ready.png)
Once new project is created, this is the default contents.
![hello world](/img/hello_world.png)
We'll go to project options menu and check roxygen option for documentation. 
![project option](/img/project_option.png)
![roxygen](/img/roxygen.png)
![roxygen options](/img/roxygen_options.png)
![roxygen ready](/img/roxygen_ready.png)

Now let's create our own function. 
![r script](/img/new_r_script.png)
![r script name](/img/r_script_name.png)
![load all](/img/load_all.png)
Let's test the new function by loading the functions. No need for sourcing anymore!
![loaded](/img/load_all_done.png)

Now that the function is working as intended, let's document the function for others, including future us. 
![insert roxygen](/img/insert_doc.png)
![document done](/img/doc_done.png)

Keyboard shortcut: cmd-shift-D generates the documents. 
![generate document](/img/generate_doc.png)
![check document](/img/check_doc.png)
Let's remove the default contents. 
![delete hello](/img/rm_hello.png)
Now that we have working functions and associated documents, let's finish up writing functions/docs, and install the R package we just wrote.

Keyboard shortcut: cmd-shift-B
![install and restart](/img/install.png)
Let's check if the package is without any issues. 

Keyboard shortcut: cmd-shift-E
![check package](/img/check_pkg.png)
![check progress](/img/check_progress.png)
Check result is not clean. There is a warning and a note. We'll need to address them. 
![check warning](/img/check_warning.png)
Let's fix importFrom. 
![check import fixed](/img/check_warning_fixed1.png)
Then let's fix DESCRIPTION. 
![check description fixed](/img/check_warning_fixed2.png)
Once all issues are addressed, we see the check result is clean. 

Let's build the source package (no shortcut)
![build source package](/img/build_src.png)
![build source progress](/img/build_src_progress.png)

## Share
Three different ways to share our new R package.

1. If you are the only user of the R package, then no additional action is required. cmd-shift-B (install step) installed the development version of the package already. 

2. If you want to share your R package with co-workers, you can (sftp) copy the zipped/built source file to a common location and have you co-workers them install the package in their R session by install.packages("/path/to/pkg", repos = NULL) 

![Setup git](/img/build_src_progress.png)

![Restart after git](/img/restart_after_git.png)
![Git pane](/img/git_pane.png)
![commit](/img/commit.png)

3. If you want to share your R package with total strangers out there, you can share all source files in github (or any other version control systems) and have them install the package in their R session by devtools::install_github("user/repo")
