<p>While working on yet another separate blog post, I needed to insert images in the post. I knew from rmarkdown syntax that I can use: ![image name](path to file), but then I didn’t know where the image files need to be.</p>
<p>It turns out I can have the image files under the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/static-files.html">static/</a> directory, everything under which will be copied to public directory.</p>
<p>Moreover, static/ directory can also be used to build Rmd documents (e.g., pdf and HTML5), and I decided to try generating an HTML5 slide using <a href="https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1">xaringan</a> package. It took some trial-and-error but eventually I got it working and here’s the <a href="https://joongsup.rbind.io/slides/r_pkg_devel.html">slide</a>!</p>
<p>(Next, maybe I should consider breaking out posts and slides.)</p>
