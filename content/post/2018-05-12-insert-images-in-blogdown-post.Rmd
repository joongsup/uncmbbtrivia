While working on yet another separate blog post, I needed to insert images in the post. I knew from rmarkdown syntax that I can use: !\[image name](path to file), but then I didn't know where the image files need to be. 

It turns out I can have the image files under the [static/](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/static-files.html) directory, everything under which will be copied to public directory. 

Moreover, static/ directory can also be used to build Rmd documents (e.g., pdf and HTML5), and I decided to try generating an HTML5 slide using [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1) package. It took some trial-and-error but eventually I got it working and here's the [slide](https://joongsup.rbind.io/slides/r_pkg_devel.html)! 

(Next, maybe I should consider breaking out posts and slides.)
