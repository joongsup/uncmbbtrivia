<p>Here we go again. 3 Ls in a row. When was the last time we had this kind of losing skid?</p>
<p>So the last time there was a 3-game losing streak was back in 2014, and to my surprise,</p>
<p>I got curious as to what the worst losing streak was since 1950 season. To do that I’m looking at the number of seasons with losing streaks up to certain nuber.</p>
<p>So as seen earlier, one in every four seasons, we’ve seen at least one occasion of 3-game losing streaks. What gets me is that there’s been seasons in which we had 4+ game losing streaks! Let’s see what those seasons were and what were those games for those seasons with at least one 6-game losing streaks.</p>
