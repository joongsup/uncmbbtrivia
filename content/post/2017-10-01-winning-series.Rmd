Here it is, the very first trivia! Frankly I was initially curious which schools have kept winning against UNC and found out which, but to start off things on a positive note :) I'm posting which schools have never won against UNC since 1949-50 season while having played UNC at least 10 times. 

```{r, label = hardest, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}
#------------------------
# head-to-head w/ other schools
# w/ at least 5 matches since 1949-50 season
#------------------------

#a

```

There they are: Citadel, Rutgers, Stanford, and Tulane! Two of these teams are on UNC's schedule for upcoming 2017-2018 season, so it'll be interesting to see if UNC can keep the winning streak.
